# finite-square-well-demo

quick and dirty demo of pseudopotential concept using 1D finite well/barrier scattering problem. Follows discussion in Richard Martin Electronic Structure textbook problem ???. See also Scherrer problem ???.

The main feature of this demo is an animation of a plane wave scattering past a finite square well. The well depth (a) and width (V0) can be adjusted. Normalized to ???. The transmission coefficient is given by ???. For the animation, the incident wave is normalized to ???. Full solution given by ???.

Pseudopotential concept:
Given a well of width a and depth V0, other values of V0 and a can be found that do not alter the transmission coefficient (transmitted/incident). So we have a \*pseudo\* potential that essentially creates the same scattering scattering properties outside the well. The same concept applies to pseudopotentials in the atomic case, where scattering properties outside some core radius need to match the all-electron case.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requires Python 2, matplotlib, scipy, numpy

### Running example

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Running with your own paramters

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
